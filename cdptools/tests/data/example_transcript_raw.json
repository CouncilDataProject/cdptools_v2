Just a couple of other things that happened last week that I am very proud of thank you to Brian's you in my office for organizing some work that we did in the public life study in Pioneer Square working with us. The first time we had about 45 volunteers. I think we've had Italy had at least that for the last couple of days what we do is actually count the number of people. Were there coming and going either sitting what kind of behavior is going on? Then that becomes part of s. Basic information for either Investments or deciding what we need to do to make it a safer place. So I'm excited about the fact that the first time that have been done in our city hall Park area and it just want to acknowledge all the people that joined on that is pretty interesting. I was a council member Pacheco join me. We were standing over by the fountain and as many of you know, there is often times less than what you consider to be positive behaviors. And this one woman came up to me and she said how come there's no garbage cans down here. We clean that up, but there were garbage cans and I just acknowledge the fact that that is really true if people don't have garbage cans handy and they are dwelling in a particular place are going to throw the garbage on the ground, which is what happens and we continue to have to clean it up so we'll be worth. With parks and with SP you just to see if we can do something at temporarily the summer to help clean that up and to empower the people who are there actually clean clean up with them and for themselves. Also, we want to acknowledge the great work that was done Dan Strauss Brian and Lena in my office helped organize a design charrette for Uptown South Lake Union Belltown last Friday. We spent the entire day with some of the best Architects and designers. Ask. Other who had 45 people there that really know their stuff and looking at what we can do to make Thomas Street East of the arena and west of the Arena a place that people feel safe and excited about with art and better lighting as part of what we're doing this afternoon or this morning later with our Civic development around the arena. I will bring this up again about what we can do but the real key thing 4S. And others is that these changes need to be done by October 20th. So when the puck is dropped that we've got these designs him play and that they're safer more encouraging for pedestrians and bikes and everybody to get there. So just want to bring that up for a notice. And again thank u s. For all your work and again October 20-21 these things have to be in place and not like delayed and delayed. So if we need budget items we going to do it this year for good morning. Good morning. It's Wednesday, July 17th. It will be three items on the agenda a briefing a public hearing are not annual compliment docking resolution. This is a resolution that sets the dockets of amendments of the council consider next to an amendment from sdci directory Nathan Torkelson on the permit back locking backlog and a briefing from opcd on their industrial and work plan and for the events for this. I'm really happy to partner with councilmember Gonzalez on our domestic violence is domestic violence lunch and learn on services in gaps will be looking for system have some challenges that we currently have it in our existing systems.

So, thank you very good. Thank you can smell worse. Everybody so I don't even know where to begin. So I'm going to do the the the regular stuff first and then I wouldn't have a few other words. First of all, I want to thank councilmember herrboldt for our lunch and learn that we did for the AIDS Memorial pathway last week and it was a success and we learned all about how the AIDS Memorial pathway is going to I was going to be built and how the program with the artwork is going to look like. It was a very emotional and beautiful presentation where people have the opportunity to enshrine the historic and current efforts of Advocates fighting to end HIV AIDS discrimination. I'm so many young lives were lost in the 80s and 90s has disease and for us the city for the first time to have a memorial and art to commemorate and honor their lies was amazing. So thank you again. Cancel her both a big thank you to cancel a Rasmussen of his continued. Advocacy Christopher Paul Jordan the artist Randy enstrom are Arts director Jason plourde and Michelle. Fashion with A&P. That's the AIDS Memorial pathway amp and Christian Ramirez from arts for their creativity hard work and Leadership again. I was contacted by counseling Rasmussen got almost two years ago in this first started and we all got money in the budget and this Council approved it and moved it forward. So it's nice to see these type of Memorial things finally coming to fruition. So just briefly council president. I know that you're sharing today's Civic Arena is at 10:30 where we're going to as you said talk about the overlay district for sale Center the Key Arena facility use agreement with Seattle Storm and the public skate plaza near Thomas Street, and as you know council president, this is in line with the three prior Agreements are ordinances at this Council passed the development agreement to lease agreement in integration agreement, and I want to give us all cuz we never really do this for ourselves all of us who were here and certainly our support of a big pat on the back cuz we passed this 1.6 billion dollar project for a new Seattle Center. And we're on our way and no. No taxpayer dollars and that's no easy feat. I think we're the only city in the country that has done that that actually owns the property no taxes and we're moving for another are there tax mechanisms, but did local taxpayer would not be paying for like like we did with soda and then blew it up after we paid off the bonds. So anyway this Wednesday July 17th. I have my committee Civic development public assets and Native communities and the Seattle public libraries will present their 2018. Rsji.

I've been driving by this this piece of property for over 30 years. It's on the North Fork of Thornton Creek. It's absolutely beautiful. It's for sale and we're hoping that we can buy it and preserve it and we can create an opportunity for more green space up not only up in defy but obviously for the city of Seattle, so I look forward to the committee and the briefing and what we're going to learn about how we can purchase this property big. Thank you to the County council member Dombrowski and Jesus.

Thank you to council member Gonzalez, Mascota and Pacheco. We are all texting this weekend and we all felt a certain amount of Familia family about the New Politics not New Politics of go back to where you come from what that kind of paranoid and predatory form of politics does to our people is violence and I guess I just to a point in my life where every time I think things can't get any worse or something has gone away. It hasn't it comes back like a worse than a bad rash except for this point. It's people who are literally living in fear and 10 cities. I have to continue to remind people that human values Progressive values are democratic values, and I don't know what I'm going to tell my children's grandchildren are my grandchildren when they say mom, what did you do? When all this was going on? I just feel like we have to do something and I completely know council member Gonzalez and mascara and I know all of you do and Pacheco. I reached out to those three because of our our history and our background and I would like to remind people that when you say go back to where you come from we are where we come from and the North America is Our Land. And I just want to end on that note that I hope we're going to move forward and and people are not going to give up and allow this type of hate and racism divide us. Thank you for your kind words to say thank you. I mean as always one of the things that I love about this council is the fact that we really are coming from lots of different places. But thank you for bringing this up and one of the most outrageous things when I heard that those tweets was not only the stupidity the anger the hatred that that continues to foment, but also the absolutely irresponsible nature of those comments because at least three of the four women were born here in this country, please I think it's wrong Cincinnati Detroit. It's about as outrageous as statement as I could have ever heard. But then as it's absolutely not true. We are all Americans here. We need to be supporting each other. Thank you for reaching out. I'm in let's just continue this sense of of us miss. We're all together in this figure out a way that we can continue to lead in our city to be as strong as we possibly can. I just want to acknowledge the fact that I recognized how much additional pain that you've gone through and thanks for bringing it up. Thank you. What is your microphone on this council? Member Harrow says I have very short report today. I have Regional committee update attended Puget Sound Economic Development board last week attending the Flood Control District board this week. And then on Sunday, I just want to say a few words about the fact that the South Park Library is having a reopening celebration. For those of you don't know their recently been some refurbishments done to the library was closed for two months and they are improvements that have been made are to support the changing ways that patrons are using the libraries and to make the branch of more enjoyable useful Place to Be steady and collaborate and the event will be happening Sunday between 2 and 5 p.m. And there Will be a variety of the festivities. I hope you can join us if there's going to be two items on today's full Council agenda from the housing Health Energy and workers rights committee. The first is a bill that I'm very excited about and I believe all of you are as well. That's amended Council Bill 11954 to this ordinance relates to provider inflationary adjustments for Human Services or social service contracts. I just want to say thank you to a handful of you for engaging with us on writing amendments and to all of you for being at various hearings over the last six months and provide for providing your input as we tried to identify ways to lift up our social service providers who was especially are providing services to our most vulnerable as you'll remember last year in the budget. We allocated a 2% increase to both non general fund and gentle fun contracts in last year's budget cycle. We also Committed at that time to trying to find a way to stabilize that type of adjustments so that every year where there's an inflationary adjustment. The contractors don't have to worry about how they're going to make up the difference. And the reason that this is so important as we're talking about services for Youth Development senior centers Community clinics folks who are serving those who experience domestic violence and sexual assault. Also helping to prevent that type of situation are those who are working in food banks and meal programs and homeless shelters as well as prevention from falling into homelessness by providing housing assistance. We talked about this being the backbone of the social service network in our city and the consequence of us not having the ability to give inflationary adjustments automatically year after year that sometimes resulted in organizations having 40 to 50% turnover and vacancy rates in these very organization that are trying to provide services. So one of the things that I'm really excited about his work the council president Harold has done over the last few days, which is to Elvis identify an amendment that I will be fully supporting that recognizes our intent is to make sure that we're stabilizing his workers. And yes, we have inflationary adjustments needs that are affecting the cost of rent and utilities and other operational costs and the consequences those are fixed cost and where we have a flexible or variable cost. We see a reduction sometime staff when the physician vacates The Physician turns over it's not filled and sometimes you know, we recognize that people are taking other jobs because it's much more affordable are for them to be able to stabilize our family. So really appreciate the work you did come to present Harold over the last few days to help us include that intent language and thank you for bringing that Amendment forward today. I also want to thank councilmember Bagshaw for her work with us as we worked on. How do we evaluate all of these dollars going to actually help us stabilize these organizations. Are they providing a direct impact the workers? Are they providing a direct impact to the client? Thank you for the work that you've done especially on that look back. As we do the evaluation? And also make sure that that evaluation doesn't just sit on a shelf that there will be action on it. So we should all of you and council member of Ryan is not here, but I want to say thanks to him that he's been bringing this issue up in customer herbold. I know you got a chance to talk to some of the folks last week at the rally. So that was really fun. Thank you all for your engagement on this issue. I know it's been a long time in the making and excited to see us get this over the hurdle today. I appreciate all of the work that you have done as well. So I don't really want this to become a thank you with on but seriously your heart and the way that you approach this is very meaningful and to all of you who were I'm at the meeting or not at the meeting last week. I had proposed an amendment that would make sure that the 2020 budget in the 2021 budget work. But it was quite clear that that fish all the amendment was not going to pass but also I want to acknowledge that supporting the service providers is one of the most important things we can do and you thread the needle very, well. I'm delighted with the resolution that you're bringing forward council president that you to draft it over the weekend that will acknowledge Our intention that we would like this money to go into work or salaries. We also know that we can't dictate that but it's a it's a good first start something that we are doing and I'll be working with our budget office and I'm over the next few months to make sure that that's Incorporated in whatever budget action that the mayor brings down so that we can not get distracted during our actual October and November but budget deliberations. Hopefully we can just move forward with this and not continue to have to debate whether it's a good idea or not. Council agenda the appointment of Victor Lozada from for serving on the domestic worker standard board and with his appointment the board it will now be complete and I his appointment seat was chosen by the board as we outlined in the legislation really excited to have the full domestic workers board Standards Board up and running the very month that we went live with these new requirements for domestic workers on July 18th at 9:30.

These are two of the items that we were going to discuss last week. And we're moving to this week's agenda will also have a possible vote on the notice of intent to sell it. Malaysian and discussion.

We're going to be adding to your amazing packet of Hotel worker legislation materials are revised copy of our schedule will be adding basically another month to the discussion so that we can have it more in-depth discussion about the four components of the legislation and appreciate your own staff bringing us the ideas for a rolling out additional times of those work really well for us and I think my colleagues on the committee will agree. We will try to do a better job of outlining what can be expected of those committee meeting so that we're not talking in a million things like you said last week so much to do at a time line here and we will get it done by October. I'm by by September then weekly visit of the Tacoma stability State people might know this is where we have the large tent.
