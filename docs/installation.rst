Stable release
--------------

To install cdptools, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install cdptools

This is the preferred method to install cdptools, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

The above command only installs the basic dependencies of the project.
As each CDP instance is different, you will need to install the dependencies speicifc to that instance:

* Seattle: ``pip install cdptools[seattle]``

Or to install dependencies for all cities use:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install cdptools[all]

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.
